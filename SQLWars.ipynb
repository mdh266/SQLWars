    "--------------\n",
    "Coming from a computational science/applied mathematics background many of the ideas of data science/machine learning are second nature to me. One thing that was very new to me was creating and manipulating databases. In computational science we don't really deal with databases and I/O is something to avoid as much as possible because it limits performance.  Therefore, in this blog post I'll be going what I have learend about SQL databases, i.e. what they are, how to set them up, and how to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL And What I'll Cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a domain specific language used in programming to deal with data that is stored in a relational database.  SQL is designed for a specific purpose: to query data contained in a relational database.  There are plently of good references on how to learn SQL query commands, two that I used are,\n",

    "\n",
    "However, this is not what I intend to cover here.  Instead, I would like to look at how one can create and interact with different implementations of SQL databases.  And specifically how to do this using Python.  There are many different implementations of SQL: SQLite, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.  The basic operations on SQL databases that are common to all the implementations are described in the acronym, C.R.U.D.:\n",

    "- **D**elete: How to delete rows from a table in the database.\n",

    "For now the SQL implementations I'll be focusing on are,\n",

    "\n",
    "As we'll see most of the differences between working with the two implementations will be in how we create the databases.  The queries will be relatively the same, but the libaries we use to interact with the databases will be different depending on the SQL implementation. I'll be updating this blog post as a time goes on, so check back later for new additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let me go over two topics: relational databases and the client-server model for databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "### Relational Database Model\n",
    "This model organizes data into one or more tables (or \"relations\") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by adding a column for the unique key of the linked row (such columns are known as foreign keys). Most physical implementations have a unique primary key (PK) for each table. When a new row is written to the table, a new unique value for the primary key is generated; this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables. When a primary key migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key in the other table. This can be seen below where the primary key, <code>ID</code>, in the <code>School Table</code> becomes the foriegn key, <code>School ID</code>, in the <code>Student Table</code>:\n",
    "\n",
    "![primary-foriegn](./images/Primary-Foriegn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When each cell can contain only one value and the primary key migrates into a regular entity table, this design pattern can represent either a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship. A one-to-one relationship exists when one row in a table may be linked with only one row in another table and vice versa. A one-to-many relationship exists when one row in table A may be linked with many rows in table B, but one row in table B is linked to only one row in table A. The above diagram of relationship between the <code>School Table</code> and the <code>Student Table</code> is an example of a one-to-many relationship.  There is also a many-to-many relationship, but this is more complicated and we wont discuss it. The example I will work below will involve a one-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-Server Model For Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "The client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.  The resource/service in the case of a database is the data stored in it. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function. Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.\n",

    "<a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/\">SQLite</a> was the first relational database that I learned.  It's fast, lightweight and filebased. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.  SQLite stores the entire database (definitions, tables, indices, and the data itself) as a single cross-platform file on a host machine.  SQLite is also embedded into Python naturally with <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html\">sqlite3</a> which we will be covering in this post.\n",

    "While SQLite is fast and easy, it can't handle many concurrent writes. It is also not great for large databases since everything must fit in one file on disk.  PostgreSQL is another great option for a relation database that is powerful and open source.  PostgreSQL databases are not limited in size and can handle multiple concurrent writes.  PostgreSQL manages concurrency through a system known as multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), which gives each transaction a \"snapshot\" of the database, allowing changes to be made without being visible to other transactions until the changes are committed. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) principles in an efficient manner. The one draw back to PostgreSQL is that is a little harder to set up, which is what I will be focusing on below.\n",

    "\n",
    "**PROS:** Requires less configuration than client-server based database. Easy to use, fast, lightweight and has native bindings to Python.\n",

    "**CONS:** Cannot handle concurrent writes, instead writes must be performed sequentially.  SQLite can handle concurrent reads, but not too many.\n",
    "\n",

    "### PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL is the best bet for a large scale open-source databases that will have heavy user traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROS:** Advanced open-source database that scales to large datasets. Can handle multiple concurrent write and reads.\n",
